Solutions to Codingame.com coding challenges

Codingame.com is an absolutely awesome website dedicated to helping programmers hone their skills by offering a wide array of different challenges all of which are unique, and difficult in their own right. 
I've committed to solving as many of the challenges in as many languages as I can and documenting those solutions here for future reference.
One of my favorite aspects of the website is the animation used while solving the challenges.  It's amazing how much help it can be to actually see your code in action.
